          <p>
            In Africa, more than 15 million people are pushed below the
            $1.90-a-day poverty line yearly due to high household health
            expenses. And more than 109 million Africans spend 10% or more of
            their household income on health. At the same time, Africa has
            become the bedrock of digital transformation. Africa comprises 16%
            of the world population and carries 23% of the global disease
            burden, yet it accounted for just 1% of total global health
            expenditures in 2015. Rethinking digitalisation to ensure that all
            people across Africa are well equipped and have access to resources
            and opportunities to fully realise their potential and shape their
            access to health care is one of the most pressing challenges of our
            time. Everybody has a role to play - but no one is better placed
            than young people as early adapters and most active technology users
            to identify the obstacles and find ways to overcome them. The
            purpose of this competition is to challenge young people to take
            advantage of today&rsquo;s rapidly changing technology to craft
            solutions to address the challenges of health financing and delivery
            in their respective countries. In addition, the competition also
            aims to inspire and create a dialogue on innovative ways to address
            some of the problems. The needs that have also been created by this
            &ldquo;technology revolution&rdquo; hinder sustainable development.

          <h3 className="section_title">Why We Are Focusing on Youth</h3>
          <p>
            Around Africa, young people see entrepreneurship as a means to
            achieve social and economic development. By lowering information
            barriers and costs and expanding access to digitalisation, the
            internet, mobile technologies and data increase experimentation and
            give rise to new opportunities for entrepreneurship for young
            people. Youth entrepreneurs are crucial in generating new business
            ideas that transform local and global communities. Youth with the
            right skills can come up with ideas, leveraging on digital
            technologies to promote business models or more efficient approaches
            which lead to benefits for economic transformation, including
            healthcare delivery. Young entrepreneurs and innovators can disrupt
            markets and create significant impact, compelling a serious
            commitment from governments and private firms to change their
            business ways. What can be done to spark the entrepreneurial
            potential inherent in African youth? How can youth entrepreneurs
            help unleash the power of digital technology, business modelling,
            private sector-led growth, and public-private partnerships to
            improve the financing and delivery of health and benefit their
            societies?
